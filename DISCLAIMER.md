# HenderForge – IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This is a personal portfolio demonstration project only.**

- HenderForge is **not** a validated, production-ready tool.
- It uses **simulated / developer-created SOPs, WIs, templates and policies** — **not** any real company's QMS documents.
- All generated documents (Risk Assessments, VP, URS, FRS, RTM, VSR, etc.) are **illustrative only**.
- Outputs are **NOT compliant**, **NOT suitable**, and **MUST NOT be used** for any GxP-regulated validation, regulatory submission, or actual Computer Systems Validation (CSV) activities.
- Real deployment in a regulated environment would require:
  - Full customisation with client-specific QMS
  - On-prem fine-tuning of any LLM
  - Complete CSV/qualification
  - Independent review and approval
- **Do NOT** rely on HenderForge (or its outputs) for any compliance-related purpose.

This project demonstrates applied AI concepts in a pharma CSV context — it is **not** a substitute for professional validation services.
