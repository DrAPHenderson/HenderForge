## HenderForge

Demonstration application using rule-based logic (and future local LLM) to generate compliant, living SDLC validation documents for computerized systems in pharmaceutical CSV.

Built by Dr. Andrew Henderson – CSV specialist transitioning to ML engineering.

## Overview

HenderForge automates parts of the Computer Systems Validation (CSV) process by generating traceable, GxP-compliant documents from user inputs and simulated QMS references.

- Offline and reproducible (local model, fixed seed)
- Supports GAMP 5 categories and 21 CFR Part 11 / Annex 11 principles
- Early development – MVP in progress
